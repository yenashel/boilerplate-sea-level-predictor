When I did not get the entirely test set working properly I checked for others solutions
and found one here: https://github.com/a-mt/fcc-sea-level-predictor/blob/master/sea_level_predictor.py

In contrast to a-mt's solution I used python's inbuilt range function rather than numpy's arrange. Due to the pre-defined structure provided in the exercise my code does not look much different.
